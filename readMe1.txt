A machine oriented language can only be used on a computer for which it has been designed. 
This language contains alphabetic codes, which are known as unmemoric codes. 
So, it is easier to remember unmemoric codes than numeric codes and it is easier to write a programme in this language.

A machine oriented language is oriented to a particular computer and not oriented to a particular problem. 
To avoid this difficulty, problem oriented languages have been developed.
It is easier to write programmes in these languages. 
These are also known as high level languages.
